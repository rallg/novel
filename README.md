# novel
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novel` is the canonical repository for the
`novel` document class, available as package `novel` in TeXlive and at CTAN.
If you find a bug in `novel` (unlikely) you may report it here.
Current version 1.86 at CTAN.

Although `novel` continues to work, its use for new projects is discouraged.
The reason is that the code is more complex than it needs to be, given the
changes in printing since its initial release.
Also, it offers features that are rarely used by writers, resulting in
overly-long documentation with many unnecessary details.

The same developer has a newer `novelette` document class, which does
less than `novel`, but it does all you really need to do, and is simpler
to learn and use. GitHub repository `rallg/novelette`.
Those files will not be ready until early 2024.
