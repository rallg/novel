# novel
LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novel` is the canonical repository for the
`novel` document class, available as package `novel` in TeXlive and at CTAN.
The current version is 1.84. It will probably be the final update.
It continues to work, but the underlying technology used by print services
has changed over the years. Some of `novel' code is now unnecessary,
and using `novel' is more complicated than it needs to be (circa late 2023).

If you find a bug in `novel` (unlikely) you may report it here. But there will
be no new features.

The same developer has a newer `novelette` document class, which does
less than `novel`, but it does all you really need to do, and is simpler
to learn and use. GitHub repository `rallg/novelette`.
Those files will be posted beginning September, 2023. But they will not be
ready for beta test until January 2024. Hoping to have them in TeXlive 2024.
