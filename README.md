LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novel` is the canonical repository for the
`novel` document class, available as package `novel` in TeXlive and at CTAN.
The current distribution version is 1.82.

The same developer has a newer `novelette` document class, which does
less than `novel`, and is simpler to learn and use. GitHub `rallg/novelette`.
Those files will be posted sometime in September, 2023.
