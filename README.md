LuaLaTeX document class for printed popular fiction

GitHub repository `rallg/novel` is the canonical repository for the
`novel` document class, available as package `novel` in TeXlive and at CTAN.
The current version is 1.84. It will probably be the final update for
TeXlive 2023, and may be omitted in TeXlive 2024. You may continue to use
it, if you already started; but do not begin new projects.

The same developer has a newer `novelette` document class, which does
less than `novel`, and is simpler to learn and use. GitHub `rallg/novelette`.
Those files will be posted beginning September, 2023. But they will not be
ready for beta test until January 2024. Hoping to have them in TeXlive 2024.
