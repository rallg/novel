To use `novel' you need LaTeX with lualatex.

In addition to the minimal setup, you will need these packages:

textpos magaz xcolor adjustbox eso-pic pdfpages unicode-math fp iftex
libertinus-fonts makecmds xkeyval lm-math xstring xifthen silence
collectbox pgf lipsum wrapfig pdflscape polyglossia microtype hyperref

You will need language support, for your language(s).
If using lipsum, you will need hyphen-latin.
